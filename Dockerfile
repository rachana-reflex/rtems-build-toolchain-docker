# Dockerfile for RTEMS toolchain build
# ====================================
#
# It's not required to use Travis CI for the build. Just use docker
# or execute provided script 'build_run.sh' directly (in this case
# ensure that GCC is available.
#

# environment shall be Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
# as it already provides GCC7 which is
# required for RTEMS build (RSB master
# is configured to use this version
# for the cross-compiler)
FROM ubuntu:bionic

# the target architecture is passed to docker
# as a build argument (docker command line call)
ARG TARGET_ARCH

# default value can be changed with --build-arg
ARG BUILD_TOOLS_PATH="/opt/build-tools"

# default value can be changed with --build-arg
ARG INSTALL_DIR="/opt/rtems"

# we require the install path in the build 
# scripts later, so export the var to the
# environment

# access is granted to the user
